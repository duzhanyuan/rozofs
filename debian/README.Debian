## ABOUT ROZOFS

RozoFS is a scale-out NAS file system. RozoFS aims to provide an open
source high performance and high availability scale out storage software
appliance for intensive disk IO data center scenario. RozoFS provides an
easy way to scale to petabytes storage but using erasure coding it was
designed to provide very high availability levels with optimized raw
capacity usage on heterogeneous commodity hardware.

RozoFS provide a native open source POSIX file system, build on top of a
usual out-band scale-out storage architecture. The RozoFS specificity lies
in the way data is stored. The data to be stored is translated into several
chunks named projections using Mojette Transform and distributed across
storage devices in such a way that it can be retrieved even if several
pieces are unavailable. On the other hand, chunks are meaningless alone.
Redundancy schemes based on coding techniques like the one used by RozoFS
allow to achieve signiÔ¨Åcant storage savings as compared to simple
replication.
